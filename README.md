# Portfolio Website

[Check-Me-Out](https://nmwolfe.github.io/portfolio/) here.

Tasked with using recently learnt skills with HTML, and CSS, the brief here was to create a personal portfolio website, implementing use of semantic HTML, and SCSS.

## Objectives

1 - Have a deployed GH pages site

2 - Be responsive

- Built with a mobile-first mindset
- Built with accessibility in mind

3 - Code is highly readable

## Delights

I enjoyed cementing my understanding of HTML with this project, and messing around (perhaps too much) with SCSS.

Having the opportunity to implement some JavaScript that I _painstakingly_ figured out, gave me a big confidence boost going forward.

## Design

Being a mobile first design, I spent the majority of my time getting it looking good on a mobile device.

The subsequent switch to desktop added some design challenges, but I overcame them with the implementation of CSS grid.

## Showcase Feature

My favorite feature of this website is the projects box, where you can switch between an image of the website project, plus the code.

## Going Forward

In the future, I will likely re-do this webpage with acquired skills with TypeScript / React.

I will also add/update the projects section with the corresponding projects.
